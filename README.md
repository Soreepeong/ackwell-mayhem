# mayhem

Pure Rust file format reader for a popular game middleware suite.

**NOTE:** This library is not feature complete;

- Current focus lies in reading binary data formats used by Final Fantasy XIV.
- Primarily designed to read the data contained by the files themselves, and does not attempt to replicate functionality beyond that scope. Avenues for struct-specific behavior may be investigated for future versions.
